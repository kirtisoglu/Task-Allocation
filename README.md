# Task-Allocation

At Nesin Mathematics Village, the daily operations mostly rely on active participation from the attendees. Alongside attending classes throughout the day, covering subjects like mathematics, art, philosophy, and theater, the participants also engage in various tasks such as dishwashing, toilet cleaning and kitchen assistance. During summer, the number of participants can reach up to 500 people, with a constant turnover as new participants arrive each week.

To foster a harmonious communal living environment, task groups are formed and responsibilities are distributed among the participants. The exact number of groups formed each week may vary depending on the program and the participants' schedule. Ensuring a fair distribution of tasks is of utmost importance. To address this challenge, [Alaittin Kirtisoglu](https://kirtisoglu.github.io/) worked on developing an integer programming model for the Nesin Mathematics Village to solve the problem effectively.  Integer programming model is shared as a pdf in the repo.

The file named Exact uses the PuLP library to search for an exact solution to the model. PuLP is able to call CPLEX and Gurobi to solve the model. 

We also worked on metaheuristic solutions to the same model with [Cigdem Cemre Bolat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ccbolat/en?originalSubdomain=tr).  The model is solved by simulated annealing algorithm. To see the repo, [click here](https://github.com/ccbolat/NMK-daily-work-assignment). The work is completed under the [Directed Reading Program Turkiye](https://sites.google.com/view/drp-turkey/).  Cigdem Cemre Bolat worked on the project under the mentorship of Alaittin Kirtisoglu.



I would like to hear from you!
